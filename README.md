# @cyberlz/react-date-range

> Maintained fork/rescue of [`react-date-range`](https://github.com/hypeserver/react-date-range).
> **Current channel**: `1.0.0` is the stable release on npm `latest`. The `rc` tag remains on `1.0.0-rc.0` for historical validation. See [Dist-tag policy](#dist-tag-policy) below.

## What is this?

This is a **personal open-source initiative** to rescue and modernize `react-date-range`,
a popular React date range picker that has been [archived by its original maintainer](https://github.com/hypeserver/react-date-range).

**Not affiliated** with the original maintainers, any commercial project, or any company.
This workspace exists on a personal machine for convenience; it carries no branding or
association beyond what is stated here.

## Why?

`react-date-range` has **2,600+ GitHub stars**, **700+ forks**, and broad real-world usage,
but the upstream repository is read-only and no longer maintained. Open issues include:

- React 19 compatibility (#661, #662)
- date-fns v3/v4 compatibility (#649, #663, #667)
- TypeScript improvements (#260, #439, #513)
- Accessibility (#373, #415 — core labels/states resolved; #416 — core labels/states resolved)
- React 18 StrictMode scroll bugs (#577, #653)

There are community forks, but **none clearly active in 2026** with a published React 19 fix.
This project aims to fill that gap.

## Install

```bash
npm install @cyberlz/react-date-range
```

```js
import { DateRangePicker } from '@cyberlz/react-date-range';
import '@cyberlz/react-date-range/styles.css';
import '@cyberlz/react-date-range/theme/default.css';
```

> **Migrating from `react-date-range` upstream?** See [`docs/migration-from-upstream.md`](docs/migration-from-upstream.md).

## Accessibility baseline

The fork now covers the core ARIA labels and states tracked by upstream #415/#416:

| Area | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Calendar grid | Named with `ariaLabels.calendar` and described with `ariaLabels.calendarRoleDescription`. |
| Defined ranges | Static range buttons expose `aria-pressed` for the active preset. |
| Input ranges | Number-of-days inputs are named by their rendered labels via `aria-labelledby`. |
| Date display | The start/end date inputs are grouped with `role="group"` and `ariaLabels.dateDisplay`. |
| DateRangePicker | Wrapper renders as `role="region"` named by `ariaLabels.dateRangePicker`; set `ariaLabels.dateRangePicker = false` to opt out. |
| Calendar live region | Committed month/year navigation announced via `aria-live="polite"` region (customizable via `ariaLabels.liveRegionMonthYear`). Hover, drag movement, date selection, and scroll do not announce from Calendar itself. |
| DateRange live region | Committed range selections announced via `aria-live="polite"` / `aria-atomic="true"` after DateRange normalizes the selected range. Customizable via `ariaLabels.liveRegionSelection`. Hover, preview, and drag movement do not announce. |

`aria-live` month/year and DateRange selection announcements are available. Announcements are tied to committed state changes only, so hover, preview, and drag-move updates do not over-announce.

## RTL layout support

`Calendar`, `DateRange`, and `DateRangePicker` accept an additive `dir` prop:

```jsx
<DateRangePicker dir="rtl" direction="horizontal" />
```

| `dir` value | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `"rtl"` | Renders `dir="rtl"`, applies the `rdrRtl` class hook, mirrors navigation glyphs visually, and reverses horizontal month flow. |
| `"ltr"` | Renders `dir="ltr"` without the RTL class hook. |
| omitted | Leaves `dir` unset so the calendar can inherit direction from an ancestor. |

The existing `direction` prop still controls layout orientation (`"vertical"` or `"horizontal"`); it is separate from text direction. Consumers can override the RTL hook with `classNames={{ rtl: 'my-rtl' }}`.

Custom `navigatorRenderer` output is not wrapped or transformed by the library. If a custom renderer uses chevrons, alignment, or directional icons, it must handle RTL mirroring itself.

## Goal

A **modern, maintained, production-ready** date range picker for React that:

- Works with **React 18 and 19** without warnings or workarounds
- Is **fully typed** (TypeScript-first)
- Has a **modern build** (ESM + CJS, real tree-shaking, no side-effect imports)
- Is **SSR-safe**
- **Preserves the existing API** so current users can upgrade without rewrites
- Keeps the compatibility surface focused on the maintained `react-date-range` experience

## Current phase

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Phase 0** — Audit & planning | Complete |
| **Phase 1** — Compatible rescue | Complete |
| **Phase 3** — Core refactor | Complete (Slices 1–21 done) |

**`@cyberlz/react-date-range@1.0.0`** is the stable release on npm `latest`.
The first milestone is complete; future work is tracked separately. See
[`docs/fork-roadmap.md`](docs/fork-roadmap.md) for the full plan and
[`docs/refactor-roadmap.md`](docs/refactor-roadmap.md) for incremental refactor slices.

## Dist-tag policy

npm has three relevant dist-tags for this package:

- **`latest`** — points to `1.0.0` stable. Default install path: `npm install @cyberlz/react-date-range`.
- **`rc`** — points to `1.0.0-rc.0`. Historical release candidate for pre-release validation: `npm install @cyberlz/react-date-range@rc`.
- **`beta`** — points to `0.1.0-beta.0`. Legacy prerelease channel.

For stable installs, consumers use `npm install @cyberlz/react-date-range` (no tag). See
[`docs/migration-from-upstream.md`](docs/migration-from-upstream.md) for upgrade instructions.
See [`docs/release-flow.md`](docs/release-flow.md#npm-dist-tags) for the full policy.

## Build pipeline

Package build produces consumable `dist/` output:

```bash
npm run build          # tsdown (JS, multi-entry + unbundle) + sass (CSS) + types copy
```

**Output:**
| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `dist/index.mjs` | ESM barrel (bundlers, `import`) |
| `dist/index.cjs` | CJS barrel (Node.js `require`) |
| `dist/components/<Component>/index.{mjs,cjs}` | Per-component sub-modules (preserved by multi-entry glob for real tree-shaking) |
| `dist/styles.css` | Compiled CSS (import separately) |
| `dist/index.d.ts` | TypeScript declarations |
| `dist/theme/default.css` | Default theme CSS |

**Consumer import (ESM / TSX):**
```js
import { DateRangePicker } from '@cyberlz/react-date-range';
import '@cyberlz/react-date-range/styles.css';
```

**Consumer import (CJS):**
```js
const { DateRangePicker } = require('@cyberlz/react-date-range');
require('@cyberlz/react-date-range/styles.css');
```

No custom Vite/esbuild loaders required — the compiled output is plain JS/CSS.

**Smoke-test fixtures:**
- `spikes/consumer-js/` — JS consumer importing compiled output
- `spikes/consumer-tsx/` — TSX consumer with type validation (`tsc --noEmit`)
- `spikes/tree-shaking/` — Tree-shaking analysis (Calendar-only vs DateRangePicker)

### Tree-shaking

Tree-shaking works since `0.1.0-alpha.3` and remains part of `1.0.0`. The build uses `tsdown` with `unbundle: true` and a
multi-entry glob, so each component is emitted as its own file and bundlers can drop unused
exports. Verified empirically with `spikes/tree-shaking/analyze.mjs`:

| Consumer import | Output size |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `import { Calendar }` | ~41 KB |
| `import { DateRangePicker }` | ~58 KB |
| **Delta** | **+17 KB** (real tree-shaking) |

CJS consumers do not benefit equally (CJS is not tree-shakeable by design); ESM + modern
bundlers (Vite, Webpack 5, esbuild, Rollup) get the full benefit.

### Not committed for `1.x`

- Breaking API changes
- Speculative visual redesign tracks such as dual skins or Tailwind theming
- New features

## Demo and documentation roadmap

- **Local demo:** [`demo/`](demo/) is the current verified Vite consumer for `@cyberlz/react-date-range@1.0.0`.
- **Public demo:** <https://sokaluis.github.io/react-date-range/> is deployed with GitHub Pages from `demo/`.
- **Full library documentation:** planned after the landing baseline, covering component props, examples, migration notes, styling, accessibility, and roadmap status.

See [`docs/docs-site-plan.md`](docs/docs-site-plan.md) for the landing/docs plan and
[`docs/post-1.0-roadmap.md`](docs/post-1.0-roadmap.md) for the broader post-1.0 direction.
