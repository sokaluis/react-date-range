- SSR compatibility
- Bugfix track (`1.0.x` maintenance)

---

## Immediate docs gap

~~**Full component docs** — the only remaining open item in `docs/docs-site-plan.md`.~~ ✅ Complete.

Component reference is live at `docs/components/README.md`. The next open execution
candidate is the **Configurable UI foundation** track, which requires a separate API design
spec before implementation (see below).

---

## Configurable UI foundation (complete — `1.3.0`)

Foundation complete, tagged as `v1.3.0`, published on npm `latest`, and documented
with a GitHub Release. Stable UI slots,
`className`/`style` per slot, and opt-in CSS token surface are all in place. This
foundation now unlocks the Styling System / Skins track.

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Toggle header elements | ✅ Shipped |
| Selected date display | ✅ Shipped |
| Today affordance | ✅ Shipped |
| Calendar count (1 vs 2+) | ✅ Shipped |
| Scroll orientation | ✅ Shipped |
| Stable styling slots | ✅ Shipped |
| CSS token surface | ✅ Shipped (opt-in `tokens.css`) |

---

## Responsive / Mobile (unscheduled — candidate for future)

Requires separate spec. Not yet specced; no release target assigned. Styling System /
Skins foundation is the recommended next execution candidate after `1.3.0` handoff.

- Mobile fullscreen / sheet mode
- Responsive layout modes for Calendar and DateRangePicker
- Touch improvements (swipe, gesture support)

---

## Styling system (unscheduled — candidate for future)

Base `uiSlots` and `tokens.css` are available from `1.3.0`. Remaining work
includes higher-level styling API, size variants, and skin/template system.

- Size variants (compact, comfortable, spacious)
- Icon slots for nav arrows, clear button
- Skin/template system (classic, booking, dashboard, etc.)

---

## Advanced Rules (1.6 — exploratory)

Requires separate spec.

- Disabled date rules (callback-based, not only array)
- Min / max range length
- Business days mode and holiday calendar support
- Validation hooks

---

## Out of scope / Non-goals

- New framework wrappers before `@cyberlz/date-range-core` (2.x/Labs)
- Skins/templates before tokens/slots are stable
- Framework-specific wrappers (Vue, Svelte, Solid) before core extraction
- Features not covered by a reviewed spec

## Relationship to other docs
